  "summary": "REQ-2 (circle entry/navigation) and REQ-3 (prevent Start Chat crash via safe navigation + safe Principal parsing with a friendly empty state) appear implemented. Global Chat seeding data is added and used when backend feed is empty, but the diff summary is truncated so it’s not fully verifiable that the old empty-state copy (“Be the first to share”) was removed everywhere. Home page quote data/randomization is present, but truncated diff makes it unclear whether a dedicated quote section is actually rendered at the end of the page after “Your Journey Continues.” Several unrelated UI/theming and onboarding changes appear beyond the requested scope.",

      "reason": "The diff implements seed messages so the feed is non-empty when backendMessages is empty, but the provided GlobalChatPage.tsx content is truncated and does not show whether the previous empty-state text was removed/changed (it could still exist in UI branches not visible in the truncation).",
